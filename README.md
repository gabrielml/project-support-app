# üöß Support App - Helpdesk

This repository, currently under development, will contain the backed API for a support ticket system. Developed using **Java 21** and the **Spring Boot** framework, the API will provide essential functionality for submitting new requests, retrieving lists of queries, and managing their lifecycle, including updating and deleting records. **Spring Data JPA** will be used for data persistence with a **MySQL** or **H2** database.

## üîç Strategic approach

The development of the _IT Support Application [API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MmWEYR2a8)_ followed a 
**structured**, **design-first methodology** to ensure a **clean**, **maintainable**, and **requirement-compliant codebase**. 
This approach  prioritized **planning & clarity before implementation**.

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis & Design

The first step was a thorough analysis of the provided requirements to define the system's core entities and their
interactions. The key decision was to model the domain with two primary entities:

1. `SupportRequest`: The central entity capturing all details of an IT support ticket, including the requester's information,
description, status. and resolution details.
2. `QueryTopic`: A simple entity representing a pre-defined category for a support request (e.g., "Hardware", "Software",
"Network").

A critical design choice was implementing the `attendedBy` field as a simple `String` attribute within the `SupportRequest`
entity, as the requirements specified that "the name is sufficient". This avoided the unnecessary complexity of a separate
`AttendedBy` entity that had been developed during [the first iteration of data modeling](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qDHQL90SybGKDVy8zojMT8z7ynZN-CD/view?usp=sharing),
which would likely caused over-engineering.

The relationships between these entities were mapped out using three standard diagramming techniques to ensure **conceptual**,
**logical**, and **physical** clarity:


* **[UML Class Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODXg0HTggSDxivPcBdUDmPM8onAAww1D/view?usp=sharing)**: Defined
  the Object-Oriented structure of the application's _Model Layer_, specifying attributes, methods, and the crucial
  **"has-a"** relationship between a `Supportrequest` and its `QueryTopic`

This model adds more detail to the conceptual model. It represents the **"how"** of a system from a design perspective,
independent of a specific programming language or database.

An analogy might be a detailed architectural **blueprint** (plan) of a building, showing the rooms, their functions, and how they connect,
but not the specific materials to be used.

The primary audience for a UML class diagram is the **development team** (i.e., Software Engineers, Developers, Architects,
Q/A Testers, Project Managers, and Technical Writers). It is a key artifact for anyone who needs a deep,
technical understanding of the application's core structure.

### Phase 2: Project Setup & Agile Planning

Following the design phase, the project was initialized using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). 
The [Jira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software)) backlog was structured into epics, user stories, and tasks 
based on the requirements, ensuring traceability and providing a clear roadmap for the two-week sprint. 
Development follows a Git Feature Branch wit Jira workflow (`key-N-[features || technical & documentary deliverables]`,
e.g. `PITSA-5-IT-view-requests`) to isolate changes and facilitate code reviews before merging into the main development branch.

### Phase 3: Incremental Implementation

The implementation strategy is to build the application incrementally, following the priority of the user stories:

1. **Foundation**: Implement the core entities (`QueryTopic`, `SupportRequest`) and database repositories.

2. **Employee API Functionality**: Develop endpoints for employees to list query topics and submit new requests.

3. **Technical Department API Functionality**: Develop endpoints for the technical department to list, update, and manage
support requests.

4. **Validation & Testing**: Concurrently write [unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and [integration tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)
for each layer (Models, Services, Controllers) to meet the 70%+ [test coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing) requirement.

5. **Project Documentation & Deliverables**: Integrate [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/) for interactive API docs and compile a complete 
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection for testing and demonstration.

This methodical, diagram-driven approach ensures the [API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MmWEYR2a8) is built on a solid architectural foundation,
minimizing refactoring and aligning closely with all specified functional requirements.
