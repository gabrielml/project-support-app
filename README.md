# ðŸš§ Support App - Helpdesk

This repository, currently under developmnet, will contain the backed API for a support ticket system. Developed using **Java 21** and the **Spring Boot** framework, the API will provide essential functionality for submitting new requests, retrieving lists of queries, and managing their lifecycle, including updating and deleting records. **Spring Data JPA** will be used for data persistence with a **MySQL** or **H2** database.
